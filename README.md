# Manjaro Setup

To avoid a Yossarian, don't bother cloning this repo, just grab the scripts.

Manjaro does come out of the box with curl, wget and git (I think). So it's probably fine anyway.

```shell
wget --quiet https://github.com/bencromwell/manjaro/raw/main/install-1.sh
wget --quiet https://github.com/bencromwell/manjaro/raw/main/install-2.sh
wget --quiet https://github.com/bencromwell/manjaro/raw/main/install-3.sh
wget --quiet https://github.com/bencromwell/manjaro/raw/main/install-4.sh
wget --quiet https://github.com/bencromwell/manjaro/raw/main/install-5.sh
wget --quiet https://github.com/bencromwell/manjaro/raw/main/install-6.sh
wget --quiet https://github.com/bencromwell/manjaro/raw/main/install-7.sh
```

Then go through each one and run them.
